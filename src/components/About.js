                  First, we set out to widen the range of products available on our platform, focusing on products that consumers regularly need, such as groceries, personal care and sanitary products. We then boosted visibility for these products under the Big Daddy Everyday umbrella.<br />
                  But even with ever-increasing variety, consumer enthusiasm was stalled <br />by the recurring delivery fees associated with purchasing everyday products online. Consequently, we decided to offer free delivery on a wide range of  frequently purchased products at the start of the year.

                  This required a concerted effort from the commercial team, marketing, logistics, and other departments. For instance, our commercial team had to revisit stock level management in anticipation of the order increases expected to result from the free delivery initiative.<br/>
                  Furthermore, the marketing team had to create sufficient awareness for free delivery offers.
